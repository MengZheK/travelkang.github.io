I had the great fortune of returning home for Christmas during one of the most incredible summers New Zealand has put on in years. I rejoiced in my return with a flurry of burgers, home-cooking and drinkable tap water, reflecting that there's nothing quite like time away to remind you how good the people, places and burgers are in your own backyard.
