Yesterday I caught a rickshaw out to the tombs of the seven Qutub Shahi rulers. The Qutub Shahi dynasty lasted over 150 years from 1518 to 1687 and it was during this period that the city of Hyderabad was founded by the 5th ruler, Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah.

A rather gloomy day, I was reminded of that fact that it's still monsoon season in this region as it began to rain torrentially shortly after my arrival. A warm, almost comforting storm that served as an excellent soothing agent for the headache I'd earned from a night of drinking at one of the bars in nearby Hitech city.
