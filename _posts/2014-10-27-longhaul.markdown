Tonight marks the beginning of a course in Vipassana meditation I have chosen to undergo. Part of the package is 10 days without communication of any kind and therefore radio silence for my journaling. Before I begin I wanted to share a brief photo-essay of the 4-day journey up to Jodhpur, Rajasthan.

With a brief intermission to explore the famed caves of Ellora, it was a marathon spread between sleeper buses, trains and a final stint in "general", the unassigned seating option in passenger trains where I experienced a new blend of Indian bedlam. Aided at every step of the way by welcoming families, humble individuals and patient tellers, I cannot speak highly enough of the warm character shown to me by the Indian people.
