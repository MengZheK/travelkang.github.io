After [arriving in Sikkim](http://travelog.io/india/sikkim/2014/11/30/sikkim/), I spent the first week of December hiking with a party of six into the Indian Himalayas. Our goal was Goecha La, a mountain pass some 5,000 metres above sea level, which leads to the base of the third highest mountain on the planet, Kanchendzonga. Even though we were aided and abetted by a hard-working crew of guides and porters the experience was incredibly strenuous.

Hiking at altitude is no joke; as the atmosphere began to thin, we found ourselves suffering for even the slightest physical exertion. Above 4,000 metres the effects became very apparent and, even with an approach of slow acclimatization, few of the party were able to avoid its impact. That there are people capable of hiking Everest (8,800 metres) without an oxygen supply to assist them is an achievement that has new meaning.

The Himalayas are a place of absolute magic, often with conditions in weather and landscape changing before your very eyes. This was a dreamland for photographers and explorers alike and I garnered an immense respect both for the enormity of the earth we live on and for those mountaineers brave enough to go out and chart it.

        The trail up to Goecha La is shared by hikers, yaks and sometimes horses. For a party of six, as many as five or six yaks are employed to cart goods up and down the mountain and this makes the walk a minefield of manure â€” some of which you can see in the right photograph above. While on the road, they provide a valuable source of nutrition in the form of milk each morning. A cup of yaks-milk tea becomes a surprisingly coveted luxury after 7 days hiking.

       After 4 long days of hiking, we finally arrived at our destination: The highest lookout of the Goecha La pass. At 5,000 metres, any physical exertion became a very real struggle. Our efforts were rewarded by an exceptionally clear day and panoramic views of the Himalayan mountain ranges. The biggest reward of all, of course, was in the knowledge that the only direction we had left to travel was downward.
